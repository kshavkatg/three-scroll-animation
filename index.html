        <h2>ABOUT THE PROJECT /</h2>
        <h3>CLONE X IS OUR MOST AMBITIOUS PROJECT YET,THE BEGINNING OF A WHOLE ECOSYSTEM FOR OUR COMMUNITY, QUALITY-FOCUSED, HIGH-END AVATARS, READY FOR THE METAVERSE.</h3>
        <p>
          CLONE X Corp was founded by three extraterrestrials who came from the planet of Orbitar in the Draco constellation. These interplanetary tourists have come to accelerate our evolution towards an immaterial existence. They plan to transfer all human consciousness into advanced clone forms to create the ultimate Metaverse.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this advanced civilization, humans no longer reside in an organic form but are instead represented by their digital CloneX avatars. This ground breaking technology has revolutionized Homo sapiens's ability to self-express themselves through customizable avatar identities. This development also allows Clones to travel across galaxies and expand our civilization into new galaxies and simulations.
